# Info 📕

Josh.exe is my second Malware and probably works for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

I spend 3 days working on this shit... Sorry for it.

Note: I not tested on Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 because my PC is a trash for running virtual machines.

# Warning ☢️

I'm not responsible for what you will do with this software.

If your PC explodes in your front resulting on a nuclear war that will destroy the planet, i will not care 👍
